### Collections in Java ************

 * he Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate
   the group of objects

 ## Java Collection framework provides many interfaces ##
                 (Set, List, Queue, Deque)

 ## Java Collection framework provides many classes ##
   (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)

 ## What is a framework in Java
   * It provides readymade architecture.
   * It represents a set of classes and interfaces.
   * It is optional.


 (1) Iterator interface --> root interface for all collection class
        (Iterator<String> iterator = strings.iterator();)
      ** Iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in a forward direction only.
      ## it has 3 methods
            * hasNext()  * next() * remove()

  ## Collection Interface
       * The Collection interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the
            collection framework
       * Collection interface builds the foundation on which the collection framework depends.

    all methods of collections api implemented in subclass in collection collection framework
        (addAll ,clear)

                    iteroter -> Collection -> ((1)list (2) Queue (2) Set))

                                            list
                                             |
                        #--------------------#----------------------#
                        |                    |                      |
                        ^                    ^                      ^
                     ArrayList             LinkList                Vector ---> Stack


    * List interface is the child interface of Collection interface
    * It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection
         of objects
    * It can have duplicate values.

    ## implemented by the classes
        (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack)


   ## &&&& ArrayList

     * The ArrayList class implements the List interface. It uses a dynamic array to store
        the duplicate element of different data types (non-synchronized)

        *The elements stored in the ArrayList class can be randomly accessed

 ## LinkedList

     * LinkedList implements the Collection interface. It uses a doubly
          linked list internally to store the elements
     * It can store the duplicate elements. It maintains the insertion order and is not synchronized

     * the manipulation is fast because no shifting is required

 ## Vector

    * Vector uses a dynamic array to store the data elements. It is similar to ArrayList.
      However, It is synchronized and contains many methods that are not the part of Collection
      framework.

 ## Stack
    * The stack is the subclass of Vector. It implements the last-in-first-out data structure
    * Stack. The stack contains all of the methods of Vector class and also provides its methods like boolean push(),
      boolean peek(), boolean push(object o), which defines its properties.

                PriorityQueue                                                Deque Interface
                                                                                   |
                                                                                   |
                                                                                   ^
                                                                                ArrayDeque


 ## PriorityQueue
    * The PriorityQueue class implements the Queue interface. It holds the elements or objects
     which are to be processed by their priorities. PriorityQueue doesn't allow null values to
     be stored in the queue.

 ## ArrayDeque
    * ArrayDeque class implements the Deque interface. It facilitates us to use the Deque.
      Unlike queue, we can add or delete the elements from both the ends.

    * ArrayDeque is faster than ArrayList and Stack and has no capacity restrictions.

                                                                            ^
                                                                          TreeSet


 Set Interface in Java is present in java.util package. It extends the Collection interface.
 It represents the unordered set of elements which doesn't allow us to store
 the duplicate items. We can store at most one null value in Set.

 ## HashSet
  * HashSet class implements Set Interface. It represents the collection that
     uses a hash table for storage.
  * Hashing is used to store the elements in the HashSet. It contains unique items

 ## LinkedHashSet

    *LinkedHashSet class represents the LinkedList implementation of Set Interface. It extends the HashSet
         class and implements Set interface. Like HashSet, It also contains unique elements.
    * It maintains the insertion order and permits null elements.

 ## SortedSet Interface

    * SortedSet is the alternate of Set interface that provides a total ordering on its elements.
    * The elements of the SortedSet are arranged in the increasing (ascending) order

 ## TreeSet

    * Java TreeSet class implements the Set interface that uses a tree for storage.
    * Like HashSet, TreeSet also contains unique elements. However, the access and retrieval time of
        TreeSet is quite fast.
    * The elements in TreeSet stored in ascending order.
