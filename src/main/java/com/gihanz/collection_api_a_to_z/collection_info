### Collections in Java ************

 * he Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate
   the group of objects

 ## Java Collection framework provides many interfaces ##
                 (Set, List, Queue, Deque)

 ## Java Collection framework provides many classes ##
   (ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet)

 ## What is a framework in Java
   * It provides readymade architecture.
   * It represents a set of classes and interfaces.
   * It is optional.


 (1) Iterator interface --> root interface for all collection class
        (Iterator<String> iterator = strings.iterator();)
      ** Iterator interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in a forward direction only.
      ## it has 3 methods
            * hasNext()  * next() * remove()

  ## Collection Interface
       * The Collection interface is the interface which is implemented by all the classes in the
            collection framework
       * Collection interface builds the foundation on which the collection framework depends.

    all methods of collections api implemented in subclass in collection collection framework
        (addAll ,clear)


 ## List Interface
    * List interface is the child interface of Collection interface
    * It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection
         of objects
    * It can have duplicate values.

    ## implemented by the classes
        (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack)


   ## &&&& ArrayList

     * The ArrayList class implements the List interface. It uses a dynamic array to store
        the duplicate element of different data types (non-synchronized)

        *The elements stored in the ArrayList class can be randomly accessed
